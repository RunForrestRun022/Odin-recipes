    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
<li>
    Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
<li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.

</li>
<li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.

</li>
<li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).

</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook Spaghetti</h4>
    <ol><Li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.

    </Li></ol>
    <h4>To Finish</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.

        </li>
    </ol>
<h3>Tom and Lizzies Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Storing/Make-ahead: The meat sauce can be made in advance and should last in your refrigerator for up to 3 days and in your freezer for about three months.
    </li>
    <li>If the flavor of the sauce doesn’t pop, you probably need a bit more salt.
    </li>
    <li>If the sauce is too acidic, a pinch of sugar will do the trick.
    </li>
    <li>If the sauce tastes light on flavor, think about adding a few dashes of fish sauce or a few minced anchovies or anchovy paste (both add a rich, savory flavor).
    </li>
    <li>Adding a leftover rind of a parmesan wedge to the sauce at the same time as adding the tomatoes adds richness and extra flavor. It won’t melt all the way, just remove what’s left before serving.
